# Geometrio

## Introduction

Welcome to my Geometrio game project! This project is a part of a course taught by ChrisCourses.  Here, following his course, I have created a simple singleplayer game where you shoot at enemies to gain a score. In this README file, I will explain a brief overview of main features in this project.

## How to Play

1. **Shoot Enemies:** Use your mouse to aim and shoot projectiles at the approaching enemies.
2. **Avoid Collisions:** If an enemy collides with you, it's game over.
3. **Achieve High Score:** The game keeps track of your score, so aim to eliminate as many enemies as possible to earn a high score.

## Game Mechanics

- **Shooting Projectiles:** You can shoot projectiles at enemies to eliminate them and prevent collisions.
- **Shrinking Enemies on Hit:** When you hit an enemy, it shrinks, some enemies require multiple shots to fully destroy.
- **Game Score:** Your score increases with each enemy you eliminate. Try to beat your own high score or challenge your friends!

## Getting Started

To get started with Geometrio, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to launch the simulation.
